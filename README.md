TSP solving algorithm for multiple travelers using Genetic Algorithm.

For dividing cities to travelers, k-means algorithm used with small differences to original one.
Within cities, Genetic Algorithm used to solve Tsp, but instead of random created solutions at the beginning, we choose to create them with some intution.
